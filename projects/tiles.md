**The mailbox has been ingrained in mids for years, its interactivity hasn't really changed besides new functionalities appearing in order to sort them and search them directly in the mailbox.**


<div style="clear:both; max-width:75%" class="paragraph">
The aim of this project was to find an alternative way of representing the mail, and by extension the mailbox, to improve on its interactivity without breaking the existing perception of it. To have an idea of the very way a mailbox is used and perceived, I needed to define precisely who this service would be intended for. It would mainly concerns mailbox users who need to optimize their use, or more novice users who need a more visually-oriented interface.

The first rough models helped to build a grid and to think about the functionalities, the solution was to conceive the mail as a block, an integral element visually detaching itself from the grid. Wireframing was done on paper model in order to take into account each element and possible interactivity, a much more time-consuming process, but that give a better understanding than a fully-flat one.</div>

<div style="clear:both; max-width:75%" class="paragraph">The mails are represented differently according to their status. A different contrast allows a quick distinction. An email that has already been opened will gain a duller color, melting more into the grid and being less noticeable. The color of the mail will depend on its classification by user-defined folers such as 'family', or 'work'.</div>

<div style="clear:both; max-width:75%" class="paragraph">The Timeline makes it easier to control your mailbox in a selected period. It allows you to temporarily restore your mailbox to an earlier date. It is in the form of a horizontal line on which the user can annotate certain dates to possibly perform a backup. It is an alternative to skimming through pages of mails, or search.</div>

<div style="clear:both; max-width:75%" class="paragraph">The user can configure tags and filters to automate the categorization of a mail upon receipt or later. The same way, it can “Highlight” future mails in order to be specifically notified upon receipt, according to one or more particular criteria or keywords. This email will be marked with a lightning symbol in the mailbox.</div>

<div style="clear:both; max-width:75%" class="paragraph">The choice to keep the mail visible on the right side of the interface is justified by the desire to «contain» the mailbox to the maximum without hindering the use. However, it should remain flexible according to the user’s wishes. This project having been realized some time ago, today I find many problems that I had not thought of at the time.</div>
